# Introduction
Optimized People Detection and Image Recognition Using YOLOv8" is a project designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and recognizing people in images. Leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 model, the system processes annotated datasets to achieve precise object detection and classification. The project incorporates advanced training techniques, optimized parameters, and image augmentation to improve performance while minimizing training time. This solution is tailored for applications requiring real-time accuracy, such as surveillance, crowd analysis, and automated monitoring systems.
